# Consulting Canvas: Camofire, and E-commerce company

## Client Context

* $30 USD per year in revenue
* Sell about 30,000 different products right now -- but have sold 83,000 unique products
* Sell goods across 80 categories
* Small (fewer than 30 employees) company based in Utah, United States
* Good working relationship with CEO and CTO of the company

## Project Objectives

* Optimize Profitability: Maximize overall profit by balancing discount pricing, inventory levels, and sales volume。
* Improve Inventory Management: Reduce overstocking and understocking risks by aligning inventory with demand forecasts.
* Dynamic Pricing: Develop a strategy for setting discounts based on historical sales data, demand elasticity, and seasonal trends.
* Category-Level Insights: Identify underperforming and high-performing product categories to prioritize focus.

## Problem Definition

Camofire aims to **optimize its pricing strategy** for a wide range of discounted products (30,000 active SKUs, 80+ categories), Setting optimal discount prices that boost sales without sacrificing profit margins. While the primary driver is profitability (i.e., maximizing the difference between price and cost), the secondary but equally important objective is to **minimize excess inventory** to reduce holding costs and ensure quick sell-through, managing inventory effectively to prevent losses from unsold stock or stockouts. We have to Forecast demand accurately for the 30,000+ products currently sold, with insights from the 83,000 unique products sold historically. Prices need to be set **once a week** in a way that reflects demand elasticity, cost structure, and the need to clear stock swiftly.

## Risk Assessment

​	1. **Data Availability & Quality**

​	•	**Risk**: Incomplete or inconsistent data on product cost, historical discounts, and real-time inventory.

​	•	**Mitigation**: Establish a robust data management process, use a single source of truth for cost and inventory data, and perform data cleansing.

​	2.	**Model Accuracy & Overfitting**

​	•	**Risk**: A pricing model that performs well in historical tests but fails under real-world conditions (e.g., seasonal demand shifts).

​	•	**Mitigation**: Use a cross-validation approach, regularly retrain models, and conduct controlled A/B tests or phased rollouts.

​	3.	**Excessive Price Volatility**

​	•	**Risk**: Frequent or large swings in weekly prices may confuse customers and hurt brand perception.

​	•	**Mitigation**: Set guardrails for minimum/maximum price changes each cycle to maintain consistent discount levels.

​	4.	**Inventory Shortages or Overstock**

​	•	**Risk**: Over-optimizing for profit could lead to stockouts on high-demand items, while slow-moving items might still accumulate.

​	•	**Mitigation**: Incorporate real-time inventory data, reorder cycles, and daily/weekly velocity metrics into the pricing model to balance profit vs. turn rate.

​	5.	**Internal Adoption & Change Resistance**

​	•	**Risk**: Lack of buy-in from merchandising or sales teams if the model’s recommendations are seen as too complex or misaligned with brand strategy.

​	•	**Mitigation**: Involve key stakeholders early, demonstrate pilot results, and provide clear insights on how pricing decisions are made.

## Resource Requirements

1. **Data **

​	•	Historical sales data for all products (price, discount, units sold, inventory levels, and timestamps).

​    •   Customer behavior data, if available (e.g., average order value, repeat purchases).

​    •   Competitor pricing data, if feasible.

​	2.	**IT & Data Infrastructure**

​	•	A stable, scalable data environment (cloud-based or on-prem) to store and process large volumes of sales, cost, and inventory data.

​	•	Integration of pricing engine with the existing e-commerce platform for automated weekly price updates.

​	3.  **Tools:**

​    •   Machine Learning frameworks (e.g., Python’s scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).

​    •   Inventory and pricing management software.

​    •   Visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

​	4.	**Budget**

​	•	Funds for data infrastructure/tools, potential consulting or contractor fees, and staff training on new systems.

## Stakeholder Management

1.	**CEO & CTO**

​	•	**Role**: Executive sponsors, ensuring strategic alignment and budget/resource availability.

​	•	**Engagement**: Bi-weekly or monthly check-ins; high-level dashboards measuring margin improvements and inventory turnover.

​	2.	**Merchandising / Pricing Team**

​	•	**Role**: Day-to-day execution, adjusting weekly discount strategies, and validating final price lists.

​	•	**Engagement**: Weekly collaboration to interpret model outputs, refine business rules, and address special events (e.g., seasonal promotions).

​	3.	**Finance & Accounting**

​	•	**Role**: Validate cost data, track profitability metrics, ensure alignment with financial targets.

​	•	**Engagement**: Monthly performance reviews, oversight on budget and ROI calculations.

​	4.	**Inventory / Operations Team**

​	•	**Role**: Provide inventory forecasts, highlight looming stock issues, manage warehouse capacity.

​	•	**Engagement**: Weekly updates on stock positions; coordinate with pricing to avoid overstock or stockouts.

​	5.	**Customer Support / Marketing**

​	•	**Role**: Provide feedback on customer reactions to pricing changes; coordinate marketing campaigns.

​	•	**Engagement**: Ad hoc and monthly reviews to align promotions and brand messaging.

## Solution Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

    •	Aggregate historical sales, cost, and inventory data.

​    •   Analyze historical data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations between price, discount, and sales volume.

​    •   Segment products based on performance and elasticity.

​	•	Identify gaps in discount and elasticity information specific to closeout/discount scenarios.

​	2.	**Define the Multi-Objective Function**

​	•	**Objective**: Maximize weekly gross margin while targeting optimal inventory turnover.

​	•	Potential approach: Weighted function of (Gross Margin) + α * (Inventory Turnover) where α controls how strongly we prioritize turnover.

​	3.	**Model Development**

​	•	**Phase 1 (Baseline Elasticity)**: Simple statistical or rule-based approach to test price changes based on historical discount behavior and competitor data (if available).

​	•	**Phase 2 (Machine Learning Model)**: Incorporate advanced techniques (gradient boosting, random forest) considering seasonality, product category, and inventory velocity to forcast demand and optimize price.

​	•	**Phase 3 (Inventory Integration)**: Add dynamic rules that automatically adjust price when certain stock thresholds are hit or if items have lingered too long.

​	4.	**Testing & Validation**

​	•	Pilot test on a subset of SKUs (e.g., 2-3 categories) to measure change in margin and turnover vs. control group.

​	•	Weekly updates; gather feedback from customers and internal teams.

​	5.	**Iteration & Scalability**

​	•	Refine model based on pilot outcomes, gradually scaling to cover all categories.

​	•	Implement continuous model monitoring and periodic retraining.

​	6.	**Deployment & Automation**

​	•	Integrate with Camofire’s e-commerce backend for automated weekly price changes.

​	•	Build dashboards to track real-time gross margin, sales volume, and inventory stats.

## Value Measurement

1.	**Gross Margin per SKU/Category**

​	•	Track changes in gross margin after implementing optimized prices.

​	•	**Goal**: 5–15% margin increase without overly harming sales volume.

​	2.	**Inventory Turnover**

​	•	Monitor how quickly items are being sold off, especially discounted closeout items.

​	•	**Goal**: 10–20% improvement in turnover rates.

​	3.	**Sell-Through Rates (Weekly/Monthly)**

​	•	Evaluate how many items are sold vs. introduced each week/month.

​	•	**Goal**: Reduce slow-moving stock by a defined target (e.g., 15–25%).

​	4.	**Customer & Internal Feedback**

​	•	Collect qualitative feedback from customer support on price perception.

​	•	Engage merchandising and finance teams on how the new pricing system impacts daily operations.

​	5.	**ROI & Project Payback**

​	•	Compare cost of the pricing solution (development, tools, consulting) with additional profit and reduced inventory holding costs.
